# Easy-Wi

## Service administration

Being a hoster requires a webinterface that eases your daily work. Also clans and sponsoring projects do not want to give up the comfort a webinterface can bring them.

## Quick start

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easy-wi/installer/master/easy-wi_install.sh
bash easy-wi_install.sh
```

## What to expect

* Responsive design for all kinds of screens and devices, designed to serve in a user-friendly way.
* Easy-Wi can manage various services like Teamspeak 3 and game servers in a distributed fashion.
* Services can be monitored and auto restart on crash activated
* Using Symlinks for shared files decreases the game server installation to a few seconds. Using symlinks will reduce the disk usage for each server to a few Megabytes instead of many Gigabytes.

* Independent or in combination with the webspace MySQL or MariaDB can be managed.
* A CMS to manage your pages and news.
